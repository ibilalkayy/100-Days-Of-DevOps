This repository is used to document my journey of **100 Days of DevOps** challenge. The reason for this documentation is to help others understand the things that are required for *DevOps*.

This journey will not cover all things about "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.

I have created 100 videos for 100 days. So if you don't understand the documentation, you can watch the videos also.

I hope you will enjoy this journey. Happy learning!
